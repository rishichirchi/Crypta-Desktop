# Crypta Desktop Application



Crypta Desktop is an advanced digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) application.This is the cross-platform desktop application for the Crypta project, built with the Flutter framework. Designed for anomaly detection and pattern recognition across system data and network activity, Crypta leverages AI/ML models to classify system risks, identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), and provide actionable insights. With support for real-time forensic analysis and a user-friendly interface built using Flutter, it ensures secure and efficient investigations.

## Why Crypta?

- **Automated Forensic Data Collection**: Automates tools like FTK Imager, Volatility, RegRipper, and Sysinternals Suite using Python libraries (PyEWF, MemProcFS, Regipy, and PSUtil) to analyze forensic images, memory dumps, registry hives, and background processes.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Uses Wireshark and Scapy for packet capture analysis and identification of suspicious network activities.
- **IoC Identification**: Detects anomalies with custom YARA rules and correlates known IoCs using MISP databases.
- **AI/ML Integration**: Employs TensorFlow models for anomaly detection and risk classification, prioritizing critical artifacts for investigators.
- **Cross-Platform Dashboards**: Real-time data visualization, interactive timelines, and exportable reports in PDF, JSON, and CSV formats.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with FastAPI, Next.js, and Flutter for high performance and easy deployment.
- **Live Drive Detection**: Enables investigators to connect drives and perform real-time forensic analysis.
- **Chatbot Insights**: Provides detailed explanations of detected anomalies through an integrated chatbot.
